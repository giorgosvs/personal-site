            ðŸ‘‹ Hola! I'm Giorgos - 27 years on Earth and counting.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like everything about rhythm and music, cycling, sunny days, and
            boxing. I've always had an eye for cool visuals, which is why I ended up creating all
            the posters for our band's live gigs
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I'm chanelling that same creative mood into web development and app design - building stuff that looks good <b>and</b> works well.
          </p>
          <p>Letâ€™s see where that takes me!</p>
        </>
